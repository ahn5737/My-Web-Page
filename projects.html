	<h2>Light Control Gate Using PIR Sensors</h2>
		<div id="light">
			How nice would it be if the lights turn on automatically as I enter my room and turn off when I exit? To make this happen, I picked up a Microcontroller (Texas Instruments MSP430 LaunchPad), few light bulbs, and two pyroelectric sensors to make a sensor gated light control system. This was a very affordable proejct; it only costed a meal or two! Click <a href="">HERE</a> for the link to the code.
