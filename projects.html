	<h2>Light Control Gate using PIR Sensors</h2>
		<div id="light">
			How nice would it be if your room knew when to turn the lights on or off for you? To make this happen, I picked up a Microcontroller (TI MSP430 LaunchPad), a few light bulbs, and two pyroelectric sensors to make a light control gate system. Essentially, the system keeps track of how many people are in the room to switch the light on as long as there is someone in the room and turns it off when nobody is there. This was a very affordable proejct; it only costed a meal or two! Click <a href="https://github.com/hailey-ahn">HERE</a> to view my code.
